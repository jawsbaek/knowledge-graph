# Knowledge Sources & Reference Materials

## Official Methodology Sources

### Project Management
- **PMI (Project Management Institute)**: https://www.pmi.org
  - PMBOK Guide and methodology frameworks
  - Standard practices for project management
  - Certification programs and best practices

### Agile & Scrum
- **Agile Alliance**: https://www.agilealliance.org
  - Agile principles and practices
  - Community-driven insights and case studies
  - Training resources and events

- **Scrum Guides**: https://scrumguides.org
  - Official Scrum methodology documentation
  - Authored by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland
  - Definitive source for Scrum framework rules

### Systems Engineering
- **SEBoK (Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge)**: https://www.sebokwiki.org
  - Comprehensive systems engineering knowledge
  - Structured in graph-like format (perfect for our use case)
  - Academic and industry best practices

### Technology Trends
- **ThoughtWorks Technology Radar**: https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar
  - Current technology and methodology trends
  - Industry adoption patterns
  - Risk assessment for new approaches

## Implementation in Knowledge Graph

### Evidence Integration
Link these sources as Evidence nodes in the graph:

```cypher
CYPHER 25
CREATE (pmbok:Evidence {
  name: "pmbok-guide",
  title: "PMBOK Guide",
  url: "https://www.pmi.org",
  source_type: "standard",
  credibility_score: 9.8
})

CREATE (agile_manifesto:Evidence {
  name: "agile-manifesto", 
  title: "Agile Manifesto",
  url: "https://www.agilealliance.org",
  source_type: "manifesto",
  credibility_score: 10.0
})
```

### Sample Data Reference
See [data/sample_data.cypher](mdc:data/sample_data.cypher) for current evidence implementations.

### API Integration
Use [src/knowledge_graph/api/routers/evidence.py](mdc:src/knowledge_graph/api/routers/evidence.py) to manage these knowledge sources.

## Content Mining Strategy
1. **Automated Extraction**: Parse methodology documentation
2. **Expert Knowledge**: Interview practitioners and consultants  
3. **Case Studies**: Real-world implementation examples
4. **Academic Research**: Peer-reviewed methodology studies
5. **Community Contributions**: Open source methodology evolution

## Quality Assurance
- Credibility scoring (0.0-10.0) for each source
- Source type categorization (standard, guide, manifesto, research)
- Regular updates to reflect methodology evolution
- Citation tracking for rule validation
